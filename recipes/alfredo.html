    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Chicken Alfredo is a rich, creamy pasta dish featuring fettuccine noodles
      tossed in a garlicky, cheesy Alfredo sauce topped with Cajun-seasoned,
      pan-seared chicken breast. The pairing of tender pasta and flavorful
      chicken creates a comforting, crowd-pleasing meal perfect for family
      dinners or entertaining guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      This dish has its roots in early 20th-century Rome, where Alfredo di Lelio
      first prepared a simple sauce of butter and Parmesan cheese for his
      postpartum wife. The original recipe has since evolved, especially in
      Italian-American cuisine, to include heavy cream, resulting in the smooth,
      indulgent Alfredo sauce we know today.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 10-12 ounce boneless skinless chicken breasts</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons olive olive</li>
      <li>2 finely minced garlic cloves</li>
      <li>1 peeled small diced shallot</li>
      <li>1 Â½ cups heavy whipping cream</li>
      <li>1 cup grated parmigiano Reggiano</li>
      <li>coarse salt and freshly cracked pepper</li>
      <li>pasta water</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Carefully thinly slice the chicken breasts in half widthwise.</li>
      <li>Season the breasts on both sides with salt and pepper.</li>
      <li>
        Add 2 tablespoons of oil to a rondeau or large pot and heat over high
        heat until it lightly smokes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the chicken breast and cook for 4 to 5 minutes. Flip it over and
        cook over medium heat for 4 to 5 minutes or until well browned on both
        sides and cooked throughout. Set the chicken to the side.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the garlic and shallot to the pan and the remaining 1 tablespoon of
        olive oil, and cook for 30 to 45 seconds.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour in the whipped cream and cook over medium heat for just 2 to 3
        minutes to heat it up. Next, stir in the cheese until thoroughly
        combined and thick over low to medium heat, which takes about 3 to 4
        minutes. Season with salt and pepper and set it to the side.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the pasta to a large pot of boiling salted water and cook the pasta
        according to the package. Be sure to stir occasionally.
      </li>
      <li>
        Drain the pasta and add it to the pan with the sauce, tossing until
        coated. You may need to add a ladle or two of pasta water to thin out
        the pasta sauce so that it coats the pasta evenly.
      </li>
    </ol>
